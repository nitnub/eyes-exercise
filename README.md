# Eyes Exercise

This exercise utilizes mouse tracking to update the DOM. Move the cursor around the screen and the eyes will follow.


## How to Run
To run this project, simply navigate to [https://nitnub.github.io/eyes-exercise](https://nitnub.github.io/eyes-exercise/).


## Roadmap of Future Improvements
* Offset adjustment that scales with the distance of the cursor from a given eye for more accurate eye movement.
* Random blinking / click to blink.
